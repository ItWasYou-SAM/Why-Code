# DECISIONS

Dated, contradictable decisions. When a decision is overturned, we append a new
entry linking to the old one — *that is the exact behavior our product must
implement on other people's repositories, so we practice it ourselves.*

## D-0001 — 2026-10-19 — Build order inverted against risk

**Decision.** Component 5 (retrieval/Q&A) is the riskiest claim in the plan.
A manual retrieval spike (hand-loaded mini-graph, hand-written Cypher, hand
written answer with its evidence) runs BEFORE Component 1 (ingestion).
Order: 0 → evidence/ground-truth + spike → 1 → 2 → merged 3+4 → 5 → 6(cut).

## D-0002 — 2026-10-19 — Golden questions require human-written ground truth

**Decision.** A golden question cannot enter the suite until a human has
located the actual artifacts (PR / comment / commit) containing the real
answer and recorded them. Question without ground truth is deleted, not
deferred. "7 of 10" is meaningless otherwise.

## D-0003 — 2026-10-19 — Supersession is pairwise LLM adjudication, not a graph heuristic

**Decision.** A "later PR touched the same region" heuristic produces
false supersession (extension, revert+reapply, pure refactor). Supersession
is adjudicated claim-vs-claim on the same target with the two evidence packs
in the prompt, capped to pairwise relationships only.

## D-0004 — 2026-10-19 — Decisions must reground before storage

**Decision.** Schema validation (Pydantic) catches malformed JSON, not
invention. Before a decision is persisted, an evidence-regrounding check
verifies the cited excerpt actually substantiates the claim. No reground →
decision rejected, logged with reason.

## D-0005 — 2026-10-19 — Scope cuts for the hackathon window

**Status.** active

Cuts: Docker (demo frozen before), OpenTelemetry (structlog only), Aura
Agent / MCP (bolt-on at end or never), Next.js (single static page calling
the API; React Flow only if the answer service is done).

## D-0006 — 2026-10-19 — httpx target is provisional until ground-truth pass

**Decision.** The flagship questions must be traceable in httpx history
before it stays the target. If ground truth fails, swap repos (candidates:
pytest, requests, zappa). Architecture is repo-agnostic.
